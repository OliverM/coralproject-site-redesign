# Guides

Strong community is about more than software. Our guides will help everyone in the newsroom be intentional about their community choices, whatever technology you use.

[Our blog](http://blog.coralproject.net) currently hosts articles about journalism and community, which will be paired with further writing to create an essential series of guides and reading.

The Coral Projectâ€™s complete guide to journalism and engagement will be released in Q1 2017.
