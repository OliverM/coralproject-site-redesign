# How to Install

To run our products, you need to install them on your own server.

This is a multi-step process, documented within our technical documentation [here]().

If you need assistance, please email our [Integration Engineer.]()

We do not currently offer a hosted/license and delivery service. If you're interested in such a service for your newsroom, please [email XXXX@mozillafoundation.org]() and we'll be in touch when we have more news.
