# Learn More

The Coral Project improves the ways that journalists and communities engage on news websites. We are building free, open-source tools for publishers of all sizes. Because journalism needs everyone.

We want to talk to anyone who might be impacted by our work. We’ve been speaking with commenters, trolls, people who never comment, people who have been harassed out of online communities; we talk to community managers, journalists, developers, offline activists. So far, we’ve interviewed more than 300 people in 150 newsrooms in 30 countries. [We want to talk to you.](https://community.coralproject.net)

As we learn, we share. We’ve created [fictionalized personas](https://community.coralproject.net/t/our-user-personas/286) whose needs are at the heart of everything we build. We have [a blog](http://blog.coralproject.net) filled with articles from and about community experts. We have [our own online community](http://community.coralproject.net) that helps design and improve our work. We [hold](https://coralproject.net/our-first-hackathon/) [events](https://coralproject.net/beyond-comments-our-first-event/) around communities and code. Our code is open and [actively seeking contributors](https://docs.coralproject.net). We’ve even invented [a card game](https://coralproject.net/cards/) to inspire more discussion. If you have ideas of what else we can do with you, [please get in touch](mailto:community@mozillafoundation.org).

The Coral Project is a unique collaboration between the Mozilla Foundation, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, funded by a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

And the name? Coral’s intricate reef systems protect shorelines from natural disasters and give cover for nearby organisms to connect and evolve. Like coral, we aim to create the structure and provide the protection to help communities thrive.
